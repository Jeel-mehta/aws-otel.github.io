The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) JavaScript refers to some components developed to complement the upstream [OpenTelemetry (OTel) JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js) and [OTel JavaScript Auto-Instrumentation for Node.js](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib/tree/main/metapackages/auto-instrumentations-node). Below are links to guides that go over how to configure the relevant components of OpenTelemetry to send trace data to the AWS X-Ray backend.
